# Playoff-Bracket-Generator

This program formulates a playoff bracket in which teams will play against one another. 
The formation of the bracket will be based on the number of regular season games played and how many games each team has won.

The team with the most wins will be seeded against the team with the least wins, and so on, until all the teams are paired. 
If there is an odd number of teams, the team with the most wins will get a bye.
